Species that cannot adapt quickly enough are particularly vulnerable, leading to significant biodiversity loss."

These more extreme weather phenomena can cause significant damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and communities. The most vulnerable populations, often those with fewer resources, are often the hardest hit."
